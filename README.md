# Sonic Infinite Scroller Game Dev

The inspiration to build a sonic game came from Paul Cockcrell's
[codecamp](https://github.com/paulcockrell/sonic-infinite-scroller). He shows how to
build a infinite scroller sonic game with the KaPlay library that runs on the browser.
Even though I am not using his source code, I have read the learning resources for
building the game.

## Motivation

My drive is not to build a game because I like games but to build a game because I
want to get the experience of writing code in an area outside of my field of expertise.
And also because there are no games that interest me right now, so instead of investing
some of my free time on playing games I rather invest that time in building a game.

## References

I am using the [Xlib Programming Manual](https://tronche.com/gui/x/xlib/) as the main
resource for producing graphics/animations and for handling player input.

I am also reading the GNU/Linux [man pages](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/) for
consulting the GLIBC and libpng APIs.

Code was either borrowed or adapted from the following GitHub repositories:
- [Quake-III-Arena](https://github.com/id-Software/Quake-III-Arena)
- [xlib-learning](https://github.com/Faison/xlib-learning)
- [Xlib-demo](https://github.com/QMonkey/Xlib-demo)

These were instrumental for the development of this game, and therefore, they deserve
to be awknowledged.

## Phases

My first sonic animation, watch on youtube by clicking on the image below:

The animation was done with the code at commit [655f4af0eb658ab04cfa2320609df662605ff15b](https://github.com/misael-diaz/sonic-infinite-scroller-game-dev/commit/655f4af0eb658ab04cfa2320609df662605ff15b).

The player can switch from a running/spinning animation with the right/down arrow keys.

My second animation, sonic running on an infinite platform:

The animation was done with the code at commit [16200609797955a9da826eefcbb8437388fb2671](https://github.com/misael-diaz/sonic-infinite-scroller-game-dev/commit/16200609797955a9da826eefcbb8437388fb2671).
